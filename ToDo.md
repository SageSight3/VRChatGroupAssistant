# To Do

* Make GUI
* Look into setting up activity logger to run on pc startup or on a schedule through linux crob or windows task scheduler

### GUI Brainstorm
* Have buttons to switch between graphs of different days
* Each graph could be one day
* Checkboxes to toggle rendering for both online and total member counts
* Graph title will be day of weak and the date
* Graph x-axis should be time of day
* Graph y-axis should be member count
* Graph should have different bars to signify times the program wasn't running
* Have login window and window for group info input
* Have hub for expansion
* Have list of buttons, where each button is for a specific date, that when pressed will pop up the active member counts graph for that day. Use the date field in the log entries for this

### Feature Ideas
* Have a graph of discord member counts also

### To Update Version Number
* Update it in config_info, README.md, and Cargo.toml
